# Cinema Audience Count Prediction | Kaggle Competition (IIT Madras)

## Overview
This project was completed as part of an official **Kaggle competition conducted by IIT Madras** within the Data Science curriculum. The competition focused on predicting cinema audience count (footfall) across multiple theaters over a given time period using historical booking data.

Since the competition host disabled public sharing of notebooks on Kaggle, I am sharing my complete solution here, including the analytical workflow, feature engineering, and modeling approach.

## Problem Statement
Develop a predictive model to forecast theater audience counts using historical booking data, enabling improved demand planning and operational decision-making.

## Approach
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand audience trends, seasonality, and theater-level variations.  
- Detected data inconsistencies such as missing records, sparse entries, and outliers, and applied appropriate preprocessing techniques.  
- Engineered time-based and behavioral features to better capture demand patterns.  
- Trained and evaluated multiple regression models, implementing cross-validation to ensure robustness.  
- Tuned hyperparameters to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.  

## Tech Stack
**Python**, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Jupyter Notebook
